        "\n",
        "This notebook introduces an adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that tailors its document retrieval strategy based on the type of query. The approach integrates advanced language model prompting to classify queries and then dynamically selects the appropriate retrieval strategy, resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses."

        "## System Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The system is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional one-size-fits-all RAG approaches by adapting its retrieval method to the query’s nature. It uses a series of LLM-powered prompts to first classify the query, then to generate enhanced or reformulated queries, and finally to rank and select the most relevant documents. This adaptive process aims to yield results that are not only precise but also rich in context, making it suitable for a diverse range of query types."

        "## Underlying Concept\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional RAG systems often retrieve documents in a generic manner without considering the specific needs of different query types. In contrast, this system starts by classifying a user’s query into one of four categories: \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Factual:** For queries seeking verifiable and specific information.\n",
        "- **Analytical:** For queries that require comprehensive analysis or explanation.\n",
        "- **Opinion:** For queries that involve subjective perspectives or diverse viewpoints.\n",
        "- **Contextual:** For queries that depend on user-specific context.\n",
        "\n",
        "By differentiating between these types, the system adapts its retrieval strategy to enhance query precision, generate sub-questions when necessary, and integrate user context. This leads to richer, more coherent results tailored to the query’s requirements."

        "## System Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Query Classification Module:**\n",
        "   - Uses a templated prompt (`ADAPTIVE_QUERY_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT`) to classify the incoming query into one of the four categories.\n",
        "   - Determines if additional context is required when the query is contextual.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Adaptive Retrieval Strategies:**\n",
        "   - **Factual Strategy:** Enhances the query for precision, retrieves documents, and uses LLM-based ranking to select the top results.\n",
        "   - **Analytical Strategy:** Generates multiple sub-queries for comprehensive coverage and applies diversity selection to ensure a broad analysis.\n",
        "   - **Opinion Strategy:** Identifies distinct viewpoints and retrieves corresponding documents, then ranks them to cover a diverse range of opinions.\n",
        "   - **Contextual Strategy:** Incorporates user-specific context to reformulate the query and ranks documents by considering both relevance and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **LLM-Enhanced Ranking:**\n",
        "   - Each retrieval strategy uses specialized ranking prompts (e.g., `ADAPTIVE_FACTUAL_RANK_PROMPT`, `ADAPTIVE_CONTEXTUAL_RANK_PROMPT`) to evaluate document relevance on a scale, ensuring that the most pertinent documents are selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Response Generation Module:**\n",
        "   - Combines the selected documents into a final context and passes them, along with the original query, to an LLM (via `ADAPTIVE_FINAL_ANSWER_PROMPT`) to generate the final answer."

        "\n",
        "The adaptive RAG system leverages the **Llama Index** as its underlying database for document ingestion, storage, and retrieval. This integration is evident in the use of the `retrieve_documents` function imported from `tools.rag.llama_index.retrieve`, which loads and queries a persistent vector store maintained by Llama Index.\n",
        "\n",
        "By relying on Llama Index, the system benefits from automated document ingestion and vector indexing. Documents are processed using components like the `SimpleDirectoryReader` and, in other contexts, enriched with context windows using parsers like `SentenceWindowNodeParser`. This setup allows for efficient similarity search and ensures that the adaptive retrieval strategies (Factual, Analytical, Opinion, and Contextual) operate on a robust, scalable database.\n",
        "\n",

        "- The system starts by classifying the query using a prompt-based classifier. \n",
        "- If the query is classified as Contextual, any extracted user-specific context is captured and utilized in subsequent steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Adaptive Retrieval Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Factual:** Enhances the query, retrieves documents, and then uses a ranking prompt to score each document's relevance.\n",
        "- **Analytical:** Generates multiple sub-questions to cover different aspects, retrieves documents for each, and applies a diversity prompt to select a varied set of documents.\n",
        "- **Opinion:** Extracts diverse viewpoints from the query, retrieves documents reflecting each viewpoint, and then ranks them to ensure representative opinions.\n",
        "- **Contextual:** Reformulates the query by incorporating user context, retrieves documents, and ranks them based on both relevance and contextual alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. LLM-Enhanced Ranking\n",
        "\n",
        "- For each strategy, a dedicated ranking prompt is used to assign a score to retrieved documents, ensuring the most relevant results are prioritized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Response Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "- The top-ranked documents are then aggregated and passed into a final prompt, which instructs an LLM to generate the complete answer based on the enriched context."
