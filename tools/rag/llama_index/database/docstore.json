Here's a detailed report:\n\n### Price Comparison Report\n\n#### 1. **Data Overview**\n- **Total Number of Prices:** 78\n- **Unique Prices:** 7 (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 9.0)\n\n#### 2. **Statistical Measures**\n- **Average Price:** 4.64 (rounded to two decimal places)\n- **Median Price:** 3.0\n- **Mode Price:** 9.0 (most frequently occurring price)\n- **Minimum Price:** 0.0\n- **Maximum Price:** 9.0\n\n#### 3. **Frequency Distribution**\n- **0.0:** 8 occurrences\n- **1.0:** 18 occurrences\n- **2.0:** 10 occurrences\n- **3.0:** 6 occurrences\n- **4.0:** 2 occurrences\n- **5.0:** 2 occurrences\n- **6.0:** 1 occurrence\n- **7.0:** 1 occurrence\n- **9.0:** 30 occurrences\n\n#### 4. **Visual Representation**\n- **Histogram:**\n  ```\n  Price | Frequency\n  -----------------\n  0.0   | ********\n  1.0   | ******************\n  2.0   | **********\n  3.0   | ******\n  4.0   | **\n  5.0   | **\n  6.0   | *\n  7.0   | *\n  9.0   | ******************************\n  ```\n\n#### 5. **Analysis**\n- The most common price is 9.0, which appears 30 times, indicating a significant skew towards higher prices.\n- The average price of 4.64 suggests that the dataset is influenced by the frequent occurrence of the highest price (9.0).\n- The median price of 3.0 indicates that half of the prices are below this value, showing a concentration of lower prices.\n- The presence of multiple zero prices (8 occurrences) suggests that there are instances of free or negligible cost items.\n\n#### 6. **Conclusion**\nThe dataset shows a wide range of prices with a strong skew towards the higher end, particularly at 9.0. The average price is elevated due to this skew, while the median provides a more central value of the dataset. The frequency of zero prices may indicate promotional or complimentary items. This report can help in understanding pricing strategies and identifying areas for potential price adjustments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2068, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e7b2ffc-0366-4cce-8322-8536df99d834": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e7b2ffc-0366-4cce-8322-8536df99d834", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51909c1d-bb0e-4dcb-89fe-c5424e1a631e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2493c1b1fac2f2970c5e91b5e484eb911879949176b94aa6b8743be79e449866", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "To create a price comparison report for the iPhone 13 Pro using the average price of $5,219.51 and extracted data, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. **Data Collection:**\n   - Gather data from various sources such as online retailers, physical stores, and marketplaces. This data should include the price of the iPhone 13 Pro from each source, along with any relevant details like location, date of the price, and any special conditions (e.g., sales, discounts, or bundled offers).\n\n### 2. **Data Organization:**\n   - Organize the collected data into a table or spreadsheet. Include columns for:\n     - Retailer/Source\n     - Price\n     - Location\n     - Date of Price\n     - Additional Notes (e.g., discounts, bundles)\n\n### 3. **Calculate Average Price:**\n   - Verify the average price calculation. The given average price is $5,219.51. Ensure this is accurate by recalculating the average from your collected data.\n\n### 4. **Comparison Analysis:**\n   - Compare each price point to the average price. Highlight prices that are significantly above or below the average.\n   - Identify patterns or trends, such as certain retailers consistently offering lower prices or specific regions having higher prices.\n\n### 5. **Visual Representation:**\n   - Create visual aids such as charts or graphs to represent the price distribution. A bar chart or scatter plot can effectively show how each price compares to the average.\n   - Use color coding to differentiate between prices above, below, and at the average.\n\n### 6. **Summary and Insights:**\n   - Write a summary of your findings. Discuss any notable trends, such as:\n     - Which retailers offer the best deals?\n     - Are there any regional price differences?\n     - How do special offers impact the price?\n   - Provide insights or recommendations based on the data. For example, suggest the best time or place to purchase the iPhone 13 Pro.\n\n### 7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Conclude the report by summarizing the key points and offering any final recommendations for consumers looking to purchase the iPhone 13 Pro.\n\n### Example Table:\n\n| Retailer/Source | Price ($) | Location | Date       | Additional Notes          |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|------------|---------------------------|\n| Retailer A      | 5,100     | Online   | 2023-09-01 | 10% discount available    |\n| Retailer B      | 5,300     | New York | 2023-09-05 | Includes AppleCare        |\n| Retailer C      | 5,200     | Online   | 2023-09-10 | Free shipping             |\n| Retailer D      | 5,400     | Chicago  | 2023-09-12 | Bundle with accessories   |\n\n### Example Chart:\n- **Bar Chart:** Display each retailer on the x-axis and their respective prices on the y-axis.
